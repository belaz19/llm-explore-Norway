# Data

`raw_data.csv`

The content of this file is generated by LLM. I have asked ChatGPT to generate information about Norway's 150 tourist attractions with pre-defined columms.

`data.csv`

The raw file has been processed and cleaned with Python to produce this `data.csv`. This file is used a knowledge base for RAG fine-tuning and for the app.

`ground-truth-data.csv`

LLM has generated 5 questions for each record from the 'data.csv' file. These questions will be used for RAG evaluation and LLM evaluation.
