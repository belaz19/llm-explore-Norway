# Norway Tourist Guide

## Problem description
When you are going on vacations to Norway (or any other country), you should get familiar with what this country has to offer. What are the most popular tourist attractions, where are they located, what is the best time of year to visit them. The goal of this project is to:
1. Create a knowledge base of most popular attractions in Norway
2. Create a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) flow  which recieves a question from a user and generates an answer with LLM; evaluate different Retrieval and LLM models to fine-tune this RAG flow
3. Create an application with an User Interface, where users can ask questions about tourist attractions in Norway and get answers that help them planning vacations and not missing out important tourist attractions

## Retrieval flow
All my scipts used for discovering the best RAG flow and its components are stored in the folder `notebooks`.
